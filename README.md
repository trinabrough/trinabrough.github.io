# Trina Brough CS Career
## Database Administration Days
I worked for 5 years as a database developer. I also worked at system analysis and design as well as writing stored procedures.
## Break to raise humans
I have spent the last 20 years raising 5 amazing people.
## Return for Data Science
I returned to school in the Fall 2022 in pursuit of a CS minor in order to apply to the CS Master's Program. All the amazing new tools to work with and manipulate data drew me back! I hope to begin the Master's program Fall 2024.
